			<h3>Lesson 1:</h3>
			<b>A Catechesis in Preparation for The Celebration of CCWYD</b>
			<p>
			</p><h3>Theme:</h3>
			"Planted and build up in Jesus Christ, firm in the faith” <br />
[This catechesis is presented in three (3) parts:  during the month of June the presentation will focus on being rooted; which will be followed, in July, with being, formed and conclude in the weeks of August growing and maturing in Christ.]
			<h3>The catechesis on the theme of being rooted</h3><p>
			</p><h3>Song:</h3>
			(Pick song from WYD  THEME)<p>
			</p><h3>Prayer:</h3>
			Lord, God, we call upon you to direct us to the light and truth.  We begin this teaching to listen to your Word as the word of life.  Open our hearts and minds to hear your call.  We ask this through Christ our Lord,, Amen<p>
			</p><h3>Scripture:</h3>
			“All you who are thirsty, come to the water!  You who have no money, come, receive grain and eat; come , without paying and without cost, drink wine and milk!…Heed me, and you shall eat well, you shall delight in rich fare. . . Seek the Lord while he may be found call him while he is near.  Let the scoundrel forsake his way, and the wicked man this thoughts; let him turn to the Lord for mercy; to our God, who is generous in forgiving.  For my thoughts are not your thoughts nor are your ways my ways, say the Lord.  For just as from the heavens the rain and snow come down and do not return till they have watered the earth, making it fertile and fruitful, giving seed to the one who sows and bread to the one who eats, so shall my word be that goes forth from my mouth.  My word shall not return to me void, but shall do my will, achieving the end for which I sent it.   (Is. 55. 1-2,6-8, 10-11).We have listened to God’s word as given to us by the prophet Isaiah; now let us receive this word as being addressed to us.<p>
</p><p>
				
				</p><ul>
                                <li>Imagine God offering me His best to satisfy my deepest longings.</li><p>
				</p><li>Why was I created?  To be accepted as I am; to be born to the people who are my parents; the culture and time in which I was born.</li><p>
				</p><li>That is God’s unique gift to me.  He satisfies my deepest concerns and promises to be with me always.</li>
				</ul>

                        <p>
                        </p><h3>Leader:</h3>
			Taking this reading invite the participants from your group to accept the love of God.  The first step is to convey to your youth that God loves them, unconditionally.  God has taken the first step.  Help them to see themselves as being as they are in the plan of God.<p>

			</p><h3>Example and suggestion:</h3>
			I am me; there is no other person that is me.  This is because God from all eternity wanted ME to be.<p>

				</p><ul>
                                <li><b>Students Discuss:</b> I am not an accident; I did not become part of my family by chance.  I was welcomed into my family specifically with my mother, my father, brothers and sisters and relatives. (Affirm students no matter what their individual family situation, emphasizing that God is working His plan for them) This is not an accident.  THESE ARE THE PEOPLE GOD HAS GIVEN ME to be me.</li><p>
				</p><li>I will always live “within” my skin.  I have to take myself with me forever.  Why:  God has loved and loves me.  My culture, language, race, country and environment make up the person that has brought me to today.  God invites be to embrace it; to embrace me.  [Let us listen to God’s word as offered to us in psalm:  “When I behold your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars which you set in place-what is man that you should be mindful of him, or the son of man that you should care for him?  You have made his little less than the angels and crowed him with glory and honor. You have given him rule over the works of your hands, putting all things under his feet. (Ps. 8.4-7).</li><p>
				</p><li>Take a few moments and write in a journal what you accept as being special about you. ( or complete  Catechesis 1 worksheet  A  “me”  [Take about 10 minutes]</li>
				</ul>

			We all want to belong to a group; friends those with whom we feel we can hang out, the ones who share interests, music, sports and values.  All of these contribute to making us who we are.<p>

				</p><ul>
                                <li>During this activity of being rooted direct the participants to pair or gather in groups of three with those who have similar interests:  sports, music, recreation, technology, etc. Group assignment Cath 1 worksheet  B  “We are Alike - But Different”</li><p>
				</p><li>We belong not only to our families but also to Christ through our baptism; we now belong to the family that is the Church.  This teaching is clearly offered to us in the letters of St. John:  God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God and God in him.  …Love has no room for fear; rather, perfect love cast out all fear.  And since fear has to do with punishment, love is not yet perfect in one who is afraid”(I John 4. 16, 18).</li><p>
				</p><li>Summarize this lesson by helping the group to be more comfortable with themselves and own in what they are rooted.</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>Ending prayer:</h3>
			Dear Father,<br /> 
We have listened to your word and we know that we were created by You to be only who you created us to be. Those are the roots you have nurtured in us through Jesus,  so we can grow to be strong in our Faith. Sometimes that is difficult as we strive to be accepted. Help us to remember what your Son, Jesus has taught us, that we must abide in love.  Teach us not to be afraid because we have your perfect love. In that way, we can be the “me” You created us to be.<br />
