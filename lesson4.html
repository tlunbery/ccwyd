			<h3>Lesson 4:</h3>
			<b>Built in Jesus Christ</b>
			<p>
			</p><h3>Song:</h3>
			(WYD THEME)<p>

			</p><h3>Prayer:</h3>
			Father, you have sent us your Son to bring all creation into harmony <br />
             May we let your presence touch us as we ponder your Scriptures and <br />
             Give you glory.  We ask this through Jesus Christ, the Lord.  AMEN
<br />
<br />
<br />
			<h3>Scripture:</h3>
			"As [Jesus] was setting out on a journey a man came running up, knelt down before him and asked,  “Good Teacher, what must I do to share in everlasting life?”  Jesus answered, “Why do you call me good?  No one is good but God alone.  You know the commandments:  ‘You shall not kill; You shall not commit adultery; You shall not steal; You shall not bear false witness; You shall not defraud; Honor your father and your mother.’”  He replied, “Teacher, I have kept all these since my childhood.”  Then Jesus looked at him with love and told him, “There is one thing more you must do.  Go and sell what you have and give to the poor; you will then have treasure in heaven.  After that, come and follow me.”  At these words the man’s face fell.  He went away sad, for he had many possessions”(Mk 10.17-22).<br />
<br />
<br />
			<ul>
                                <li>Let us take a closer look at this passage from the Gospel of Mark.  A young man has obviously heard about this man, Jesus, since he addresses him as “Good Teacher.  This man approaches Jesus with sincerity.  By calling him Teacher he is open to learn from him.  In Jesus’ day, there were many apprenticeships available, including the way of studying the Jewish tradition more deeply, the TORAH.    Jesus, himself, was not a student of this tradition but as it says “The people were spellbound by his teaching because he taught with authority and not like the scribes”(Mk 1.22). </li><p>
				</p><li>This authority is not based on the courses that Jesus had taken in a rabbinic school but the total and complete genuineness in the way he related to people.  He didn’t take anyone for granted; he made everyone feel special.  He demonstrated this by what we had in a previous lesson:  healing, table sharing and suffering.  Now we come to the next step; we are actually invited to follow him.  </li><p>
				</p><li>What immediately stands out is that Jesus starts with the basic boundaries that had identified the chosen people, what we call the TEN COMMANDMENTS.  These give a basic “road map” that leads to living within the tradition of God’s people.  We all are called to build on this in our life.  Not only when is comes to being good.  When Jesus is addressed as Good that implies that he has shown in his behavior the right relation, the harmony between what he says and how he behaves.  We all do this.  We know what is expected of us but we tend to fall short.  It takes effort to be honest, carry through on our promises, see that there is more to my world than what I feel and like whether it’s music,
fun, activity, study, or being honest with my parents.  It’s not without effort to think of how my attitudes and behaviors affect those around me.  
</li><p>
				</p></ul>
The TEN COMMANDMENTS offer a guide to help keep things in focus or remind me when I have stepped out of line.  This isn’t always easy; it isn’t fun to want to do what is right.  This calls me to look at the bigger picture:  the purpose of my life, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is where we take a look at the “bigger picture” the one Jesus shows us.  I would like to call your attention to what was italicized in the reading:  “Jesus looked at him with love” here is where I should like to focus our attention for this lesson.  <br />
<br />
<br />

				<ul>
                                <li>We learn and obey the rules if something interests us.  If you want to play a musical instrument you practice the basic scale, learn how to bring sound to the notes and work on letting the sheet of music come alive.  This is true of anything we want to do.  Whether this is sports, music, technology, science, and painting and just living it has to be tried.  </li><p>
				</p><li>When Jesus looks at the young man with love he discover that Jesus offers him more that the basics; the young man is offered a chance to be with Jesus.  Let go of all distractions and spend time with him.  </li><p>
				
				</p></ul>
Mark is the only one of the Gospel writers who has this special phrase; it’s to emphasize what is offered.  <br />
<br />
<br />
ACTIVITY <font color="red">(Instructor moderate the scenario as a quiet meditation)</font>   <p>

				</p><ul>
                                <li>Take a moment to quiet yourself, close your eyes and try to meditate on the words as you hear and open your spirit to this scene. </li><p>
				</p><li>Imagine yourself being the young man who speaks to Jesus, the teacher in the reading.  You approach Jesus and are feeling good that you have done what you were taught, been responsible and are looking for reassurance for being “good”.  As you hear yourself saying “Good Teacher” you find that he is giving you his total attention.  </li><p>
				</p><li>Jesus is speaking to you and you alone, it seems.  He calls you by your name <font color="red">(pause)</font> listen as he speaks your name in a soft voice. You are nervous, self-conscious at receiving so much attention from him.  You notice that he is speaking with gentleness and calm that relaxes you and makes you forget about your worries.  As you return His gaze you feel like he is paying attention to you as though there is nothing more important than you in this moment.  He wants you to listen carefully to his words. You become relaxed and find that you are at ease.  In the silence of your heart speak to Jesus. Tell Him of your concerns. <font color="red">(pause)</font> Now in the same silence ask Him to speak to you, listen.  Pause for 8 -10 minutes in silence  </li><p>
				</p><li><font color="red">(Continue)</font> To know Jesus is offered to each one of us.  He is more that someone who has lived long ago, performed marvelous things, healed the sick and even ate with sinners.  He is present for each of us.  Let us take some time to write in our journal what I would like to ask, what it means to be called by Jesus and to be his follower.  </li><p>
				
				</p></ul>
Jesus asks the young man in the Gospel to do more than live within the boundaries that have been a part of his life up to now.  This man says, “Teacher, I have kept these since my childhood.”(Mk. 10.20 )  The young man is still operating in his world and is approaching Jesus with a pride that his world has included observing all that he was taught from childhood about God.  “I am a good person who has never failed in obeying what is expected of me.”  Jesus sees that this man may be able to be my disciple and learn from me; “Jesus looks at him with love”.  What does this mean.  Jesus wants this young man to live the secure world that he knows and respects and come to learn who the true good is, God.  <br />
<br />
<br />

				<ul>
				<li>All of us are called by our baptism to be his followers; not half done but being good as God is good.  To be good means that our behavior is in harmony with the gifts of divine life that we have received.  </li><p>
				</p><li>At baptism we were reminded, “you are a new creation, clothe yourself in Christ,”  this is what Jesus offers to us.</li><p>

				</p></ul>
Let us take some quiet time to ask the Lord Jesus to speak to us and help us to hear his words and trust in his call.  This call to the young man is that he risk being himself in the way that he addresses Jesus:  Good Teacher.  The good teacher takes advantage of the way that he was called and invites the young man to the more.  Jesus invites him to let go of his security and put his security in the good teacher.<br />
<br />
<br />

				<ul>
				<li>As we see in this story although the young man was able to be faithful to the tradition in which he was brought us he could not let go of what this teacher was offering to him.  Jesus was setting before him the “true good” which is inner freedom.  All detachment from things; the man was not able to do that.</li><p>
				</p><li>Let us look at our own lives and take an inventory of what we are attached to; what is it that we can’t let go.  Write it in your journal.  [You don’t need to share but you might want to share with one person one area that you have difficulty to let go.]</li><p>

				</p></ul>
ACTIVITY:  Invite the participants to write on a piece of paper what they would have a hard time letting go.  Suggest that they put this in a container and ask the Lord to help them to be freed of this attachment.  Take a container and burn these pieces of paper and ask the Lord to help them to let go and trust in Him.<br />
