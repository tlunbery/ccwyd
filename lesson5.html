			<h3>Lesson 5:</h3>
			<b>God’s Word and Holy Tradition</b>
			<p>
			</p><h3>Song:</h3>
			(WYD-G<p>

			</p><h3>Prayer:</h3>
			Lord and God of all creation in your word you made all things new.  May your Spoken Word invigorate us with your Spirit and guide us to trust in your saving work as entrusted to the Apostles.  We ask this through Christ, our Lord.  AMEN<br />
<br />
<br />
Let us begin with these words from Paul’s first letter to the Corinthians:  “I handed on to you first of all what I myself received…”  St. Paul is not creating something new or novel that is his own but he passes on what we call Tradition.  Let’s look at Sacred Scripture first.  We put our faith in the sacred writings that are summarized in the Law and the Prophets from the Old Testament and the Gospels and Letters from the New Testament.  Together they make up Sacred Scripture.  “Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture, then, are bound closely together and communicate one with the other.  For both of them, flowing out from the same divine well-spring, come together in some fashion to from one thing and move towards the same goal.”  Each of them makes present and fruitful I n the Church the mystery of Christ, who promised to remain with his own: always, to the close of the age.”(CCC #80).<br />
<br />
<br />
God’s word is not limited to words on a page, sounds from an instrument but is first and foremost the expression of the divine will as it has unfolded in the books of Scripture.  For the people of God the way that the divine will was revealed and understood was through the TEN COMMANDMENTS that God entrusted to Moses; this was reinforced by the teachings of the prophets to clarify and deepen the application of those teachings for God’s people.  We also speak of this as salvation history; that special understanding of God working with and through his people to make his presence felt and his will known.<br />
<br />
<br />
In time, as we hear from the letter to the Hebrews:  “In times past, God spoke in fragmentary and varied ways to our fathers through the prophets; in this the final age, he has spoken to us through his Son, whom he has made heir of all things and through whom he first created the universe.  This Son is the reflection of the Father’s glory, the exact representation of the Father’s being, and he sustains all things by this powerful word.”(Hebr. 1.1-3a).  These opening words from this letter summarize the whole of the relation of the Testaments.<br />
<br />
<br />
They are tied now to Tradition.  When the Lord Jesus rose from the realm of the dead he entrusted the work of salvation to the Holy Spirit.  What Jesus in his ministry began is now continued unabated until the end of time.  The Holy Spirit has empowered the Apostles to be the first witnesses of the resurrection and made them the ones responsible for faithfully passing on the fundamental message, teaching and life to the next generation.  <br />
<br />
<br />
The two, scripture and tradition, are intimately connected because they are as, Pope John Paul reminded us, the two lungs of the breathing of the Spirit.  Why is this important?  At the heart of the command of Jesus’ to the Apostles whom he had formed is the task to carry on what he received from the Father.  We hear clearly in the greeting that the Risen Lord extends to the Apostles:  “Peace be with you” and he said again, “As the Father has sent me, so I send you” (John 20.21).  Unless we understand this as a call that has been extended to us we can miss the whole of the divine plan.<br />
<br />
<br />
				<ul>
                                <li>Jesus didn’t come just to perform marvelous acts, show kindness to people at the margin of society, teach with authority and give his life.  All of these make up his mission.  </li><p>
				</p><li>He came, also, to empower his followers through the power of the Holy Spirit to carry on what he received as a mission from the Father.  </li><p>
				</p><li>This mission is found in the community that was established in and through the Spirit that the Lord Jesus entrusted to the Apostles.  This community became the New Israel that was formed in the saving action of the son and carried on into history.</li><p>
				
				</p></ul>
There was a central message, we call it the first announcement that the LORD JESUS ANNOUNCED THE GOOD NEWS, SUFFERED, DIED AND WAS RAISED FROM THE DEAD.  He called all to receive the Good News for the forgiveness of sins; be incorporated through baptism and share a communion that is expressed in the gathering around the Eucharistic Table.  This first presentation was intended to bring people to an awareness of God’s love for them which confirmed that they had a dignity; they, then, recognized their sins and were baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.<br />
<br />
<br />
ACTIVITY:   Divide two by two and create your own presentation of the FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT.  This is presented to the others in the group and then all help each other to evaluate whether it was convincing and persuasive.<br />
<br />
<br />
ACTIVITY:  “The Lord appointed a further seventy-two and sent them in pairs before him to every town and place he intended to visit.  You are part of the seventy-two that are sent out.  Let us listen to these words:  “I am sending you as lambs in the midst of wolves.  Do not carry a walking staff or traveling bag; wear no sandals and greet no one along the way.  On entering a house, first say, ‘Peace to this house’…Stay in the one house eating and drinking what they have…” (Lk 10:3-6)   Today it is You who brings the Good News to your friends, family, school.  Plan how you would do it.<br />
