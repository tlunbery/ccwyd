			<h3>Lesson 2:</h3>
			<b>Taking the Responsibility of Sin in our lives.</b>
			<p>
			</p><h3>Song:</h3>
			[WYD]<p>

			</p><h3>Prayer:</h3>
			Lord we know that you loved us to the extreme by giving your life for us.  This total gift shows that we, as humans, are in need of your saving love.  Open our minds and hearts in this lesson to all the keeps us from you and help us to return to your love through forgiveness.  We ask this in the name of your Son, Jesus Christ.  Amen.<p>
				
			</p><h3>[Establishing boundaries]</h3>
			We know from the story of Paradise that our first parents did not accept the boundaries that God set for them.  “The LORD God gave man this order:  “you are free to eat from any of the trees of the garden except the tree of knowledge of good and bad.  From that tree you shall not eat; the moment you eat from it you are surely doomed to die”(Gen. 2. 16-17). Suggestion: act out dramatically or have 3-4 students volunteer for Catechesis 2 – Worksheet B script read by narrator – instructor can be the narrator.<br />
<br />
<br />
					<ul>
                                <li>God created us with the ability to choose and understand.  This calls us to learn to be responsible for our actions.  We are first taught this in the safe environment of our family.  These are called boundaries; we quickly learn what is expected of us by those who love us.  This is established by setting down rules that help us to understand what is expected of us.  Sometimes, obviously, we don’t like the rules; they restrict what we want to do and what we ought to do.  </li><p>
				</p><li>An area in which we are familiar with rules and expect that they be observed is in organized sports:  all sports have their rules and when we play them we insists on having referees to make sure that in team sports everyone has the same opportunity.  
We have little trouble in sports because it’s about doing activities which we consider to the fun, we choose to be involved. </li><p>
				</p><li>That is not the case when it has to do with behavior that starts in the family, in school and wider society.   We are by nature selfish and boundaries limit our activity, unless we have chose to do it.</li><p>
				</p><li>As we have read this reading from the first book of the Bible, Genesis, we find it hard to respect boundaries that are set for us.  In the language of our faith, the breaking of these boundaries is called SIN.  Sin is defined as any action, behavior, attitude that goes against the “boundaries” set by God in the Sacred Scriptures.  </li><p>
				</p><li>As stated above, we are all by nature selfish; selfishness is the only trait that does not have to be taught.  It comes as the part of our self that rebels against rules and limits in behavior towards God and others.  We are, indeed, what our biblical tradition says we sinners.  We are in need of a redeemer; someone who has the ability to break the chains that bind us. In order to turn to Him we need to accept that we have Someone who has shown us the way and actually has the ability to bring us from sin into life. </li><p>

				</p></ul>

			<h3>Activity:</h3>
			<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~ccwyd2011/downloads/">Catechesis 2 worksheet B</a> To help the participants in the need for acknowledging one’s sins here are some readings from the Scriptures:  Psalm 51:  Have mercy on me, O God, in your goodness; in the greatness of your compassion wipe out my offense.  Thoroughly was me from my guilt and of my sin cleanse me for I acknowledge my offense, and my sin is before me always. Against you only have I sinned, and done what is evil in your sight” That you may be justified in your sentence, vindicated when you condemn.  Indeed, in guilt was I born, and in sin my mother conceived me; behold, you are pleased with sincerity of heart, and in my inmost being you teach me wisdom (Ps. 51. 3-8).<p>

				</p><h3>Before reading this parable offer to your group the following preparation.</h3>
				From the NT there is the moving parable of the Prodigal Son:  Luke 15:  11-31.<br />
<br />
<br />
				The fact that the younger son is asking for the inheritance, now, is saying clearly:  I wish you were dead!  I want my part of the inheritance now.  I am bored living with you and my older brother.  I want to go where there is some “action”.  As the younger son presents his case to the Father we hear Jesus teaching us in this parable:  “The younger [son] said to his father, ‘Father, give me the share of the estate that is coming to me.’  So the father divided up the property.<p>

			</p><h3>Direction to leader:</h3>
			Refer to the boundaries that are part of a family tradition, and in this case, the younger son didn’t care about these boundaries, he wanted the inheritance NOW.   Boundaries means that we consider others, the sin of the Prodigal Son is that he was only interested in himself.  As long as a person is indifferent to others beginning with the family, friends and God darkness and sin reign.<p>

				
				</p><ul>
                                <li>The parable speaks to us about the love of the FATHER  who accepts back the son who has squandered all.  The Father is the one who goes out to receive the son who has rehearsed his confession.  The Father embraces him and gives him full status as a son again.  Here the younger son has discovered that he had many friends as long as he paid for the parties.  Once the money ran out he was by himself.</li><p>
				</p><li>He became desperate; he even thought about going back home and offering his services as a hired hand. </li><p>
				</p><li>The Father wouldn’t hear of it; he showed the surprising love of God as Jesus tells the story. We have to own and acknowledge our sins and take responsibility for them. We need to understand that they not only affect us but those around us. We have to confess them as the younger son made his confession to the Father. </li>
				</ul>
<br />
			When we are rooted in the love of God as told in the parable by Jesus we know that the divine gift of forgiveness is an expression and completion of the divine love that is ever abundant.<p>

			</p><h3>Exercise:</h3>
			God always accepts me because God wants me to have life - not just natural but Divine Life.  Think of a time when you turned away from God and were just thinking about what you wanted to do, “have fun” and be with your friends.<br />
<br />
<br />

			God doesn’t reject you; God is always waiting.  This is most evident in that God has sent us His Son “people who are in good health do not need a doctor, sick people do” (Mt. 9.12).  Jesus came to heal us as we recognize our need.<p>

			</p><h3>THE GOOD NEWS:</h3>
			Jesus has brought to us the Good News of salvation.<p> 

				</p><ul>
                                <li>He has come from the Father with a mission to show us how to live according to God’s plan. Jesus begins the Gospel of Mark:  “This is the time of fulfillment.  The reign of God is at hand!  Reform your lives and believe in the gospel”(Mk.1.15).</li><p>
				</p><li>This Good News is not just a message; it’s the person of the Son.  He has come to serve and not to be served.  He came to give his life for us.  </li><p>
				
				</p></ul>

			<h3>Exercise: 1</h3>
			Take some time to listen to the story of the prodigal son.  Does this parable speak to me?  How much of myself do I see in his behavior?  Turn to your journal and write in your own words your confession to the Father as the prodigal son prepared his confession.<p>

			</p><h3>Exercise: 2</h3>
			Now, since you have acknowledged your sins, failures and selfish behavior set out toward your “Father’s house” and accept his welcome.  Look at his face as he is overjoyed to see you again.  He throws his arms around you and hugs you and welcomes you back.  Is this real for you?  Why or why not?<p>

			</p><h3>Exercise: 3</h3>
			To be rooted means that we have been established in the new life of grace that was received at baptism.  “Are you not aware that we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death we were buried with him, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might live a new life.  If we have been united with him through likeness to his death, so shall we be through a like resurrection”(Rom. 6. 3-5).  As we find in the baptism ceremony, “you have become a new creation and have clothed yourself in Christ.  See in this white garment the outward sign of your Christian dignity”.<br />
<br />
<br />
			We are a new creation and are rooted in Christ.  This is the Good News that allows us to live what we have become.  Let us live it with the help and guidance of the Spirit of Christ.<br />
