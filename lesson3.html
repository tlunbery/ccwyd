			<h3>Lesson 3:</h3>
			<b>Rooted in Christ</b>
			<p>
			</p><h3>Song:</h3>
			[WYD selection]<p>

			</p><h3>Prayer:</h3>
			Lord Jesus, you came to be the true and faithful servant of the Father.  Open us to your teaching and healing presence.  You came, in obedience, to fulfill the divine mission of bringing light into darkness and peace where there exists division.  May we come to know you and service you for the glory of your name. We pray in your name.  Amen.<br />
<br />
<br />
			Jesus of Nazareth is God’s gift to us. He helps us to discover the meaning and purpose of life.  Let us look at a verse in the prophet Jeremiah:  “Thus says the Lord:  “Cursed is the man who trust in human beings, who seeks his strength in flesh whose heart turns away from the Lord.  He is like a barren bush in the desert that enjoys no change of season, but stands in a lava waist, a salt and empty earth.  Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord, whose hope is the Lord.  He is like a tree planted beside the waters that stretches out its roots to the stream:  it fears not the heat when it comes, its leaves stay green; in the year of drought it shows no distress but still bears fruit” (Jeremiah 17.5-8).<br />
<br />
<br />
			Jeremiah gives us a foretaste of putting our trust in the One who is the full revelation of God.  We are invited to get to know Jesus as the one who teaches us about the meaning and purpose of life:  “”The Son of man has not come to be served but to serve--to give his life in ransom for the many” (Mk 1045).  This is the person we are invited to get to know.  The amazing thing is that Jesus is never concerned about himself but about announcing in various ways and means the coming of the kingdom of God.  How does he show that?  By the way he interacts and receives people. <br />
<br />
<br />
			One of the clearest and earliest ways that we find out about Jesus is in the way from the beginning of his public ministry he is recognized by the demons as a threat to their rule.  “There appeared in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit that shrieked:  “What do you want of us, Jesus of Nazareth:  Have you come to destroy us I know who you are--the holy One of God!”  (Mk.1.23-24). <br />
<br />
<br />
			It is not unusual that persons get uncomfortable with someone who is a challenge and calls one to grow or change.  We are looking at the person who has come to announce a new way to live.  The devils are threatened by this person.  Let us look at how he presents himself.  He comes with a mission and purpose:  “I did not come of my own will; it was he who sent me”(John 8.42).  Jesus is focused because he is not about his “own agenda” but to be the one who brings us to see in him the way to life.  Jesus shows this by calling individuals to be his disciples.  He brings them into his inner circle so that he can teach them and prepare them to carry on what he received as a mission, an assignment from the Father.  Jesus, then, has a focus.  He is not about himself  but to bring those who listen to his message and actions to a bigger picture.<br />
<br />
<br />
			We want to get to know this person.  He is the kind of person whom we want to be around; get to be close to him.  One of the ways that he communicates his mission is found in the Gospel of Luke. Jesus spends time in prayer before a major undertaking.  [Jesus] went out to the mountain to pray, spending the night in communion with God.<p>

			</p><h3>Activity:</h3>
			You cannot be present to the events of Jesus’ ministry.  They happened long ago.  You can do so, however, with an active imagination.  The theme that we are considering is getting to know Jesus as the one whom we, too, want to get to know and follow.<br />
<br />
<br />
			[Imagine yourself being present at this healing in the Gospel of Luke:  the cure of a leper.  (In the time of Jesus anyone who had contracted leprosy was totally isolated from the community that would even include his/her family.  They could have absolutely no contact with a leper even to the point of being removed from the community themselves.  It was severe; total isolation.)   On one occasion in a certain town, a man full of leprosy came to him.  Seeing Jesus, he bowed down to the ground and said to him, “Lord if you will to do so, you an cure me,”  Jesus stretched out his hand to touch him and said, “ I do will it. Be cured.”  Immediately the leprosy left him.” (lk 5.12-13).  You are there and you have been told by your family and the people of your village to stay clear of anyone who might have this affliction.  You have a difficulty even accepting that these are persons who have all their senses.  All at once you see at some distance that this man with leprosy approaches Jesus.  You get excited, you want to yell out don’t come any closer.  Jesus, don’t you see that this man is a leper and should not be allowed to come near our town.  Jesus, you observe, not only allows him to come close but he touches him. <br />
<br />
<br />
			You observe that Jesus talks to him gently and makes him feel like he is not to be driven away.  You can’t believe that Jesus is so calm and attentive to this man whom you have been taught to keep at a great distance.  You become aware that Jesus allows him to come to the village again.  The man is overjoyed and is running to the priest to have himself declared clean.  You observe all of this and you discover that you want to get to know Jesus and what he has to say and how he relates to people. <p>

			</p><h3>Exercise:</h3>
			everyone take some time to let your imagination guide you in the way that you see the action of Jesus toward the leper and your reaction:  surprise, excitement, fear, disgust, curiosity, etc. <br />
<br />
<br />
			 <font color="red">Gather in small groups and do activity 1 on Worksheet 3</font> <br />
<br />
<br />
			<b>B.</b> Jesus not only healed but he also would invite himself to share meals with those who were considered public sinners:  tax collectors, prostitutes, publicans and sinners.   To share a meal in Jesus’ day was to share more than food but a basic acceptance of those with whom he ate.  “I have not come to invite the self-righteous to a change of heart, but sinners”(Lk 5.32).<p>

			</p><h3>Discussion:</h3>
			Jesus is invited to your gathering.  What kind of questions would you want to ask him.  Can you imagine him to be there for you.  It is important that you are allowed to get to know him through Gospel stories so that you are involved and experience the very person of Jesus Lord and Savior <br />
<br />
<br />
			In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus is the New Moses.  This is presented to us in the Sermon on the Mount, chapters 5-7.  Invite the group to read the Beatitudes.  There are in the New Moses, Jesus, not more rules or commandments but embodiment, making present  the new way to understand the will of God, the mission of God as lived out by Jesus. <br />
<br />
<br />
			<font color="red">Worksheet 3 Activity 2</font><br />
<br />
<br />
			<b>1.</b>  Take the time to go through the “Beatitudes and invite your group to read each of the Beatitudes and ask them to put into their own words what they mean for them. <br />
<br />
<b>2.</b> Have them select from the 8 beatitudes two which they feel most challenging to live today. <br />
<br />
<b>3.</b> These beatitudes are lived out in the life and ministry of Jesus.  He is the one we with to know and follow. <br />
<br />
<br />
			He gives us some demanding examples:  “You are the salt of the earth…You are the light of the world”(Mt. 5.13-14)..  “Do not think that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets, I have come, not to abolish them, but to fulfill them”(Mt. 5.17).   “You have heard the commandment, ‘You shall love your countryman but hate your enemy.’  My command to you is:  love your enemies, pray for your persecutors,  This will prove that you are sons of your heavenly Father, for his sun rises on the bad and the good, he rains on the just and the unjust”(Mt. 543-44).<p>

			</p><h3>GROUP ACTIVITY:</h3>
			Jesus teaches us to love our enemies; he doesn’t do this with mere words but with his whole life. <br />
<br />
<b>1.</b> Consider someone whom you find hard to accept, trust or be around, how does the example of Jesus challenge you to be more open, receptive with this person, persons, who are different than you. <br />
<br />
<b>2.</b> One of the most difficult teachings of Jesus in this section is the final verse, vs. 44:  The Father lets the sun and rain fall not only on the good and deserving but on all.  Write in your journal this message of Jesus and how your group could act it out to teach the mercy and goodness of God? <br />
<br />
<br />
			<b>II.</b> In the Gospel of Mark we find three predictions of the Lord’s Passion:  Mk 8. 31; 9.31; and 10.31.  The Sacrifice of Jesus is the clearest expression of Jesus teaching us how he lived out the Father’s mission:  to give his life for our salvation.  The emphasis is not just how he suffered, although this is vivid and excruciating ending in death.  The central part of his sacrifice is that Jesus totally surrendered himself to do the Father’s will.  
HE WAS OBEDIENT,  that is, he learned how to listen to the Father’s will.<br />
<br />
<br />
			You, too, are invited to learn from Jesus through his example:  not mine but your will be done”(Mk 14.36b).<br />
<br />
<br />
			This hymn from Col. 1.15-20 summarizes who Jesus is for us:<br />
<br />
<br />
			<font color="red">Read this together as a closing prayer.</font><br />
<br />
<br />
			He is the image of the invisible God<br />
the first born of all creation.<br />
<br />
			In him everything in heaven and on earth was created,<br />
			things visible and invisible, whether thrones, dominations,<br />
			principalities or  powers;<br />
			all were created through him, and for him.<br />
<br />
			He is before all else that is.<br />
			In him everything continues in being.<br />
<br />
			It is he who is head of the body, the church;<br />
			he who is the beginning, the first-born of the dead<br />
			so that primacy me be his in everything<br />
<br />
			It pleased God to make absolute fullness reside in him<br />
			and by means of him, to reconcile everything in his person<br />
			both on earth and in the heavens,<br />
			
			making peace through the blood of his cross.<br />
<br />
<br />
			<b>We are rooted in the Lord Jesus.  He has revealed to us his Father’s will for our salvation.  Let us get to know him as the full embodiment of God whom we have to  privilege to know and follow.</b> <br />
